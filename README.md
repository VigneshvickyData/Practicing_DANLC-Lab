# Practicing_DANLC-Lab

This repository contains lab exercises and practice files completed as part of the **Data Analysis No Low Code (DANLC)** program. The goal of this repository is to document my learning progress and hands-on skills in data analysis using tools like **Excel, Power BI, Python**, and **Google Sheets** â€” all without using traditional programming or low-code platforms.
